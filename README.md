Overview
- Welcome to the Olympics Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Web Application! This application provides a comprehensive analysis of Olympic Games data, offering insights into medal tallies, overall trends, country-wise performances, and athlete-wise achievements.

 Sections:
1. Medal Tally:
- View the medal count for each country, filtered by year.
- Customize your view by selecting a specific country and/or year.
- Gain insights into a country's overall performance or focus on a specific Olympic year.
2.Overall Analysis:
- Explore key statistics, including the number of editions, host cities, sports, events, athletes, and participating nations.
- Visualize the growth of participating nations, events, and athletes over the years through interactive line charts.
- Delve into a heatmap showcasing the number of events across various sports over time.
- Identify the top-performing athletes in each sport.
3. Country-wise Analysis:
- Select a country to view its medal tally over the years through an interactive line chart.
- Explore a heatmap illustrating the country's success in different sports across various Olympic editions.
- Discover the top 10 athletes from the selected country.
4. Athlete-wise Analysis:
- Examine the distribution of ages among athletes, including gold, silver, and bronze medalists.
- Analyze the age distribution of gold medalists across various sports.
- Explore a scatter plot depicting the relationship between height and weight of athletes, with medal information.
- Track the participation trends of men and women over the years.

## Lessons Learned 

-	A substantial proportion of laptops, totalling around 1000 units, do not feature touchscreen functionality, while a more modest count of 200 laptops incorporates this touch-enabled capability.
-	Intel Core i7 is the most dominant, featured in about 500 laptops, closely followed by i5 with 400. Intel Core i3 has a similar count around 150, while AMD processors are less represented, with fewer than 100 laptops.
-	AMD graphics cards stand out as the most budget-friendly option in the market. They are known for providing a good budget experience. However, it's worth mentioning that laptops with AMD processors are not as common; the market is largely dominated by Intel and Nvidia. AMD tends to have a stronger presence in the desktop market.

## Limitations and What Can Be Improved

- The dataset's small size, approximately 1000 rows, resulted in notable variance, particularly in CPU and GPU models
- To mitigate this, grouping the rows by brand instead of model was implemented; however, a larger dataset would have allowed for a more granular analysis at the model level.
- Hyperparameter tuning
